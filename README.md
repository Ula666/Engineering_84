**Business** – What problem are we trying to solve?  
**Development** – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?  
**Testing** – What about this, what could possibly happen?  


- ### __Question 10__: What is a JOIN?  
__Answer__: JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. There are four types of joins: inner join, left join, right join and full join.  


- ### __Question 11__: What is a primary key and foreign key and their functions?  
__Answer__: Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in the table. There are two types of PK, simple and composite. It cannot be blank or NULL, value must never change.  
Foreign Key is a field in one table, that refers to the Primary Key in another table. It's a constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.  


- ### __Question 12__: What is DML, DDL, DCL and TLC?  
__Answer__:   
**DML** - Data Manipulation Language. Include most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.  
**DDL** - Data Definition Language, deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database. Inlude CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.  
**DCL** - Data Control Language, include GRAND, REVOKE.  
**TCL** - Transaction Control Language, include COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.  

- ### __Question 13__: What is Normalisation?  
__Answer__: Normalisation is a process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It simplifies the database design. The most popular are 1NF, 2NF and 3.  


- ### __Question 14__: What is ERD?  
__Answer__: ERD (Entity Relational Diagram)is a type of structural diagram for use in database design. It shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database.  



- ### __Question 15__: What is Git?  
__Answer__: Git is one of most popular version control systems. Every time you save your work, Git creates a commit. A commit is a snapshot of all your files at a point in time. Imagine Git as a tree structure where each commit creates a new node in that tree. Nearly all Git commands actually serve to navigate on this tree and to manipulate it accordingly. Benefits: allows you to work with many people on one project.  


- ### __Question 16__: Explain Lists, Tuples, Dictonaries and what are the differences between them?    
__Answer__:  - List is a datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values between square brackets.
List are mutable .i.e it can be converted into another data type and can store any data element in it. List can store any type of element.  
- Tuple is the sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers. Values of a tuple are separated by ‘commas’ and stored in parentheses. The main characteristics of tuples are – is immutable, it cannot be changed or replaced since it is immutable, It is defined under parenthesis(), Tuples can store any type of element.  
- Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. The main characteristics of set are – Sets are an unordered collection of elements or unintended collection of items In python. It is defined under curly braces{}. Sets are mutable, however, only immutable objects can be stored in it.   


- ### __Question 17__: What is Github?   
__Answer__: Github is an online repository saved on a cloud. It makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. It’s primary function is to allow developers to upload and maintain software.  



- ### __Question 18__: What is OOP and why should we use it?  
__Answer__: Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a programming methodology based on objects, instead of just functions and procedures. These objects are organized into classes, which allow individual objects to be grouped together. 
Benefits: Re-usability (Data Redundancy, Code Maintenance, Security, Easy troubleshooting)  


- ### __Question 19__: What is an API and why should we use it?    
__Answer__: API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system. It provides developers with standard commands for performing common operations so they do not have to write the code from scratch.  


- ### __Question 20__: Python packages and modules.  
__Answer__:   
**Package**, is a simple directory having collections of modules. This directory contains Python modules and also having __init__.py file by which the interpreter interprets it as a Package.   
**Module** is a Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables and with having a .py extension file.  


- ### __Question 21__: What is PIP?  
__Answer__: PIP is a standard package manager for Python. It allows to install and manage additional packages that are not part of the Python standard library. 


- ### __Question 22__: Four pillars of OOP   
__Answer__:    
- **Abstraction:** - is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information.  
**Example**: A radio has a tuner, an antenna, a volume control, and an on/off switch. To use it, you don't need to know that the antenna captures radio frequency signals, converts them to electrical signals, and then boosts their strength. In other words, you can say that the radio is an object that was designed to hide its complexity.  
- **Encapsulation:** - Is a process of wrapping the data and the code. It's an OOP concept which binds data and functions into a single component while restricting access to some components. The implementation of an object is hidden from the rest of the program. It keeps the data and the code safe from external interference. The main purpose or use of the encapsulation is to provide the security to the data of a class.      
**Example**: Driving a car. Do you need to know exactly how every aspect of a car works (engine, alternator, and so on)? No - you need to know how to use the steering wheel, brakes, accelerator, and so on.  
- **Inheritance:** - The ability of creating a new class from an existing class. Inherit attributes(variables) and methods(behaviours) from a parent class.  
- **Polymorphism:** - Inherit from a parent class as well as override the data. A subclass can define its own unique behavior and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class.  


- ### __Question 23__: What is Cloud Computing and why should we use it?    
__Answer__: Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale.  



- ### __Question 24__: Explain how you implemented DRY - OOP - MVC - MVT    
__Answer__: 
-**DRY** - During the Airport Project we used Django which implements DRY, an example of this is the Django base template file, from where we inherit the format using certain Django template tags. Template tags are certain elements that help us in rendering variables and templates and in inheriting Django base template file in other templates. eg.{% extends "base.html" %}.  
- **OOP** - During the Airport project we implemented OOP, one example is that we created parent class called Person and child classes called Staff and Passenger which inherited attributes from the parent class. It was useful to use OOP to reuse some facilities rather than building them again and again.  
- **MVT** - During the Airport project we implmented Model View Tepmlate pattern which breaks the code into various segments. Here we have 3 segments, model view and a controller. It's very useful becuase allows developers to change the visual part of an app and the business logic part separately, without their affecting one another.
