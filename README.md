__Answer__: Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a programming methodology based on objects, instead of just functions and procedures. These objects are organized into classes, which allow individual objects to be grouped together. 
Benefits: Re-usability (Data Redundancy, Code Maintenance, Security, Easy troubleshooting)  


- __Question 15__: What is an API and why should we use it?    
__Answer__: API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

__Answer__:    
**Abstraction:** - is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information.  
**Encapsulation:** - Makes data private from user. Providing security to data by making the variable as private and expose the property to access the private data which would be public.  
**Inheritance:** - The ability of creating a new class from an existing class. Inherit attributes(variables) and methods(behaviours) from a parent class.  
**Polymorphism:** - Inherit from a parent class as well as override the data. A subclass can define its own unique behavior and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class.
